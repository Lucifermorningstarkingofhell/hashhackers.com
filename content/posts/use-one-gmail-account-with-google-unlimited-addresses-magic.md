Google provides unlimited emails in one gmail address after a complication occurred with dot including email address and then they clarified that all dot including email accounts are same to their base name with no dots in them. But with it there are lot of other tricks a lot of people still don't know.

### Types of Google Accounts Versions

* Base Account i.e. like

```
emailaccount@gmail.com
```

* Dotted Address i.e. like

```
email.account@gmail.com  
e.m.a.i.l.a.c.c.o.u.n.t@gmail.com
```

* Base Account with another domain  

```
emailaccount@googlemail.com
```

* Dotted Address with another domain

```
email.account@googlemail.com  
e.m.a.i.l.a.c.c.o.u.n.t@googlemail.com
```

* Any of the above with Plus Sign `+`

```
email.account+i.am.above.all@gmail.com  
email.account+here@googlemail.com
```

### How to use these accounts

There are a lot of limitations on these accounts, but they aren't from google. Well, you cannot signup with a new gmail account with address `richard.live@gmail.com` if you or someone has `richardlive@gmail.com` or vice versa.

Any gmail account which has `gmail.com` at last can be replaced with `googlemail.com` and emails will arrive on the same address.

Also, put dot anywhere before @ in gmail address but should be in between letters or numbers like `richard.live@gmail.com` works but `richardlive.@gmail.com` is not valid.

You can also put multiple dots on various places in address but know that there cannot be more than one dot at the same place like `richard.live@gmail.com` is valid but `richard..live@gmail.com` is not.

Another one is Plus Sign within gmail addresses, this one is a little different as dots works in between the username of address but plus works after the username and before the @ sign. To use plus sign see the example below.

Base Gmail Address is

```
richardlive@gmail.com
```

You can create address like

```
richardlive+anythinghere@gmail.com

richardlive+anything.here@gmail.com

ri.cha.rd.live+an.ythi.ng.he.re@googlemail.com
```

After the + sign you can add anything as before + the username should be correct.
