SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the process of getting traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines. So Basically if you want to have organic traffic for your website you need to know what SEO is!

## Best SEO Plugin for WordPress

If your are using WordPress as a Blog Platform then you can use different Plugin For SEO. There are many Plugin which Provide SEO, then how to choose which is best plugin for SEO, so I am providing full Details of Yoast SEO Plugin which is best plugin for SEO in wordpress.

[Yoast SEO ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)(formerly known as WordPress SEO by Yoast) is the most complete WordPress SEO plugin that exists today for WordPress.org users. It incorporates everything from a snippet editor and real time page analysis functionality that helps you optimize your pages content, images titles, meta descriptions and more to XML sitemaps, and loads of optimization options in between.

## How To Use Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin
It is one of the most downloaded WordPress plugin of all times. Yoast’s WordPress SEO is a comprehensive solution for all your on-site SEO needs. TO Use Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin no need to be expert in WordPress as we have provided steps of how to Use Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin in very simple manner.

It allows you to add SEO title, meta description, and meta keywords to each post and page of your site.

You can also write custom title for your main site, archives, category and tag pages. It also adds Open Graph meta data, Twitter Cards, Sitemaps and ping search engines whenever you update your site. so below is how to Use Yoast WordPress SEO Plugin.

### Configure Yoast WordPress SEO for Technical SEO

Below you will find how to configure yoast plugin to use yoast wordpress plugin. The Yoast SEO settings focus primarily on technical SEO, which is a category of changes to your site to do 3 things –

1. Crawling – Search engines need to be able to be able to click through your site efficiently to find all the pages.
1. Indexation – Once search engines find the right pages, they need to be able to copy them to their index so they show in search results
1. Duplicate/Low Quality Content – You only want search engines to serve your best pages (ie, not your login page or a blank tag page), and you want search engines to find only 1 version of a page so they don’t get confused by duplicate content.


`First`, on the Yoast SEO Dashboard, you can easily verify your Webmaster accounts at various search engines. Google is the most important, but Bing offers benefits as well. Pinterest users will like the ease of this setup. Yandex is Russia’s largest search engines, and Alexa is a site ranking service by Amazon (very low priority and not necessary at all – only for curious publishers)

`Second`, go to Titles & Metas –> Other Settings. Check the following:

* Noindex subpages of archives – the 2nd, 3rd, etc pages of your blog archives are not really relevant to any searches so we’re telling search engines to crawl the posts listed in the archives, but not to actually index the subpages.

* Add noodp and noydir to meta robots tag sitewide – you’re telling search engines to use your page description – not other directories’ descriptions.

`Third`, go to Titles & Metas –> Archives and Taxonomies. The goal here is to prevent low-quality content. By default – category, tag, and format (ie, galleries, asides, quotes – depending on your theme) pages are simply lists of posts. They aren’t particularly relevant for anything someone would be searching for.

And having lots of these blank pages can look spammy to search algorithms, so we’re going to use Yoast SEO to tell search engines to click through and look at all the posts – but not to index them.

Check Meta Robots: Noindex, follow for all of your taxonomy & archive pages.

Check Hide WordPress SEO Meta Box, which is just an administrative setting. If you leave it unchecked, you can go to individual category pages and set custom title tags & descriptions…which isn’t necessary if you are telling search engines to not index the page – so I usually check Hide to keep a tidy & uncluttered WordPress admin.

The default Title & Meta Description Template looks like it’s all gibberish – but it’s just set to apply a standard title tag and no meta description to all your taxonomies so your visitors will see a title tag. By default, your category/tag pages will look like: Category Name Archives Page 1 | Site Name.

Quick aside: WordPress category & tag pages do have a lot of potential for SEO – but they require unique content & a setup that’s outside the scope of this post.

`Fourth`, go to Social and fill out the relevant fields for your social profiles so that your posts show up correctly in Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest & Google+.

`Fifth`, head to General –> Company Info. This section provides Google with markup to be included in the Knowledge Graph. It’s not a huge deal for a starter blog, but worth getting in place.

`Sixth`, go to XML Sitemaps. XML Sitemaps are basically a roadmap you give to search engines for them to use as they crawl your site. You’ll do a couple quick things here.

* Exclude from XML sitemaps any types of content that you are Noindexing (ie, tag pages, categories, etc) – same as your settings from Titles & Metas –> Taxonomies
* Take your XML sitemap URL and submit it to Google (and Bing) Webmaster Tools

Then head to [Google Search Console](http://www.google.com/webmasters) (remember you can verify your account w/ Yoast to make it easy).

`Seventh`, double-check the Permalink settings. Before you start, you do need to be using “Pretty Permalinks” which you should enable along with other initial settings. Pretty Permalinks are when your blog post URLs show up as yourblogexample.com/my-first-post instead of yourblogexample.com/?p=875. Everything in Yoast here should be good by default, but just to show what I have setup –

And you’re done! While there’s always more small things you can do, the remainder is set to a good default configuration for the vast majority of WordPress websites.

### Using Yoast WordPress SEO for On-Page SEO

Now we’ll look at using Yoast SEO in your everyday blog use to optimize your content for search engines. On every post type, Yoast SEO will place a “meta box” below the Visual Editor in WordPress. Go to Posts –> Add New and you’ll see what I mean.

This meta box is the bread and butter of Yoast SEO. Here’s what it all means.

`Nippet Preview` – this takes your meta data (ie, the page title and description) and shows you what it will look like in Google search results.

`Focus Keyword` – “what is focus keyword yoast seo” is a very common question about using Yoast SEO. It is the keyword you most expect your post to rank for, and best describes your post. In other words, if someone searched for your focus keyword, you would want (and expect) your post to show up in Google.

Filling out the Focus Keyword field in Yoast is not necessary, but can generally help you align your language with the language you expect people searching to use. Yoast will take your focus keyword and run a check to make sure you’ve used it appropriately throughout your post so that it will be obvious to search engines what your post is about. Additionally, even though Yoast SEO allows 1 field, you should be targeting a “theme” of keywords with your post so you don’t start stuffing the same keyword over and over.

`SEO Title` – often the title you want to use on your blog is not the most descriptive title for visitors coming through search engines (additionally, your page title is the #1 on-page factor search engines use to evaluate the relevance of your post). Filling out this field will replace your post title in the < title > tag while leaving the main title on your actual site. I wrote a post on how to write a great title tag here. Note – if you want to write a title tag that is longer that 512 pixels, you can. You’ll have to paste it into Yoast since the meta box won’t show it (though your website will).

`Meta Description` – this field allows you to customize the 2 lines of description that appear in the search results (and many social shares). It’s a great way to have a descriptive “advertisement” to potential visitors to click through. It’s not a ranking factor, but any keywords that appear in it will be bolded to stand out a bit more.

If you look at Content Analysis, Yoast SEO runs a quick check of your post for SEO best practices based on your focus keyword. Take all these recommendations as a very rough guide, and keep in mind that you should always write for the end user, not specifically for search engines. That said, usually these are best practices for SEO particularly because they also help the user. Look at the page analysis for ideas, but also look at your post with a critical eye towards what a user searching would be looking for and how you can answer their question.

And you’re done! Publish and now the only bit remaining for your SEO is to promote your post and get people to share it & link to it…which is one thing Yoast SEO can’t help with ?
